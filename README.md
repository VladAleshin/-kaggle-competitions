##  projects and competitions

1. Alice competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2)

Here we try to identify a user on the Internet tracking his/her 
sequence of attended Web pages. The algorithm to be built will take a webpage session
(a sequence of webpages attended consequently by the same person) and predict whether 
it belongs to Alice or somebody else. Metric ROC AUC, model logistic regression


2. Flight delays (https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight-delays-fall-2018)

Predict whether a flight will be delayed for more than 15 minutes. Metric ROC AUC, model CatBoost

3. Digital Reputation Challenge (https://boosters.pro/championship/digital_reputation_challenge/overview) 

Participants will have to predict 5 properties of character (1 - property observed, 0 - not observed) of Internet users for more personalized online marketing. Dataset consists of a digital footprint of people collected from various online sources (e.g. history of visits to websites, online shopping history, etc.). Observations in the presented set are homogeneous, test and training sets are defined randomly. Multilabel task, metric ROC AUC, models CatBoost and XGBoost (blending).

4. IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview)

The goal of the competition is to learn how to define fraud transactions.
